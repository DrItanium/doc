This file is supposed to document Unibus addresses used in the Lisp machine.
    Also see section on Xbus addresses after Unibus.

000040  60 hz clock, high order word.
000042  60 hz clock, low order word.

040000	Cheops buffer memory
057776	end of cheops buffer memory

140000-237776   (in CONS)  UNIBUS region mapped to XBUS
140000-177777   (in CADR)

300000	TV buffer
377776	end of TV buffer

764000	Cons diagnostic interface
764036	I think this is the last address used by the diagnostic interface

764040	Summagraphics tablet status register. (interrupt vector 114)
764042	Tablet X register
764044	Tablet Y register (last tablet reg)

764100	Keyboard data register
	15 garbage, 14 shift lock, 13-12 meta, 11-10 control, 9-8 top, 7-6 shift, 5-0 key
	Bits 14-0 are complemented, unfortunately.  Won't be on next machine.
764102	Bit 15 is keyboard ready bit, rest is garbage
764104	Bit 6 on writing is the interrupt enable.  Vector address = 110 (doesn't work though)
764106	Any reference to this address complements the audio output to the keyboard speaker.
764136	Last address responded to by keyboard M1710

764140	Chaos net -- Control/Status register.
764142	My number.
764144	Data register.
764146	Bit count register.
764152	Activate transmitter (upon being read!)

764200  Mouse Y register (bits 14-12 are buttons)
764202  Mouse X register (bits 14-12 are buttons)
764236  Last address responded to by mouse M1710

764300	Unibus map
	15 Write enable, 13-0 page number (bit 13 ignored)
	Except if 13-11 = 7, writes READ-MEMORY-DATA register.
	CC (CTALK) uses 70, FILE uses 77.  CCDISK (& LM itself) use 10-67 inclusive.
	Locations 0-7 are reserved for CCONS, but I don't think it uses them.
	Locations 140000-237776 are mapped, 1000 bytes per page.
764476	End of unibus map

764500  Temporary debugging interface for CADR
	Locations 764500-764536 are the 16 spy registers of a machine without a bus interface,
	in this case the kludge is plugged in to simulate the bus interface.
764576	Locations 764540-764546 are the 4 debug registers of a machine with a bus interface,
	in this case the kludge is plugged in to simulate another machine's debug connection.

766140 - 766176   CADR XBUS<-> UNIBUS mapping registers
        These map UNIBUS addresses 140000-177777.
	The CADTLK uses 766174 and FILE uses 766176, others are currently unused

775616	KL11 output buffer

776000	Cheops Control Register
776002  Cheops Status Register
776004  Cheops DBR Register
776006  Cheops MUX

776660	TV control register
	0 White on black (Read only), 1-3 Video switch select (read only)
	8-10 Channel select, 15 vertical increment mode
776662	TV pointer register
776664	TV data register (reads or writes buffer location addressed by pointer)
776666	TV data register, also writes here increment pointer by 1 or 36.
776670	TV control register 2
	0 White on black, 1-3 Video switch select
	8-10 Channel select (read only), 15 vertical increment mode (read only)
776672	TV pointer register
776674	TV data register
776676	TV data register (auto-increment on write)

776700	Xylogics disk control
776714	Last disk control register

777546	pdp11 60-cycle clock (not on bus anyway)
777560	GT40 keyboard status (not on bus anyway)
777562	GT40 keyboard buffer (not on bus anyway)
777570	pdp11 console switch register
777776	pdp11 processor status register


XBUS ADDRESSES (note: addresses here given in 24 bit form as on next machine.
   on current machine, the high bit must always be 0)

0          -    400000     real core

76,,776000 - 76,,777777    mapped to A memory locations 0-1777 by microcode.
			   (only 0-377 exist on current machine)
77,,000000 - 77,,377777    Xbus IO space.  see below for further breakdown
77,,400000 - 77,,777777    mapped to Unibus.   Each Xbus address is mapped to
			   one 16 bit Unibus location.


XBUS IO space (octant 6 of the XBUS)

03,,000000 - 03,,377777    unused.

Note: octant 7 of the XBUS cannot be accessed by the Lisp Machine,
because those physical addresses are mapped to the unibus.
