The Lisp Machine manual describes both the language and the "operating system"
of the Lisp Machine.  The language, a dialect of Lisp called Zetalisp,
is completely documented
by this manual.  The software environment and operating-system-like parts of
the system contain many things which are still in a state of flux.
This manual confines itself primarily to the stabler parts of the
system, and does not address the window system and user interface at all.
That documentation will be released as a separate volume at a later time.

Any comments, suggestions, or criticisms will be welcomed.  Please send
Arpa network mail to BUG-LMMAN@MIT-AI.

Those not on the Arpanet may send U.S. mail to

The Lisp Machine is a product of the efforts of many people too numerous to list here
and of the unique environment of the M.I.T. Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.

Portions of this manual were written by Richard Stallman, Mike McMahon, and
Alan Bawden.  The chapter on the LOOP iteration macro is a reprint of Laboratory for
Computer Science memo TM-169, by Glenn Burke.
